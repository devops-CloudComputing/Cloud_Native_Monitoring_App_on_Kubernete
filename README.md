In this project we will learn how to create a monitoring application in python using flask we will start by building the application then containerized it using docker after that we will build the docker image and then container locally, once we containerized our application locally then we will create AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) using python boto3 module next we will move to the deployment phase where we will create the Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) and deploy the application on kubernetes cluster, our application which is deployed on kubernetes will be access from the internet.

This project will help to learn many things like docker, kubernetes EKS, ECR, python etc.
